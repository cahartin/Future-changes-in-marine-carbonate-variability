<div>We were confused about some of the time series (specifically spCO2 and tos) because the minimum decreasing in magnitude (becoming more minimum) and was contradicting what we were expecting to occur. We forgot that tos and spco2 are inversely related to one another, and the time series figures tell us nothing about timing of max and min. However looking at the spCO2 and tos graphs for the NH Atlantic I am confused as to why the annual spCO2 and tos figures are not inverse to one another.</div>
