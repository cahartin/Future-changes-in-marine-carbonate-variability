<div>The minimum (top figure) is increasing while the maximum value (bottom figure) relatively constant constant. That means that the change in seasonal amplitude is being driven by the change in the minimum.</div><div>Which is what we see in the average annual cycle for pH in the Arctic NH Atlantic over for part of the historical and rcp85. The maximum value stays roughly the same around 0.016 whereas the annual min increased from -0.025 to -0.023. (Note this figure is an average over 30 years and may be influenced by the cyclic signals seen in the max and min time series.)</div><div></div><div></div>
